```shell
npm install -g @actyx-contrib/axp

The installed `axp` tool will create you a monorepo with git, ESLint, and TypeScript. In this project, you can add your apps with the `axp add <appType>` command.

```bash
axp init
```

The init step is optional. You can directly create an new app with `axp add [ui|node]`

## üìë React application

Create a new React-App with the `axp add ui` command. It will user *parcel* as build tool and setup *jest* for tests.

Additional to this. The actyx manifest for a WebView App is generated.

```bash
axp add ui --appName "awesome Ui"
```

After executing this command you will find some new scripts in you package.json

- `ui:<appName>:start` run the app in dev mode with automatic rebuild
- `ui:<appName>:build` build the React application to deploy it
- `ui:<appName>:package` use the ax-manifest to create a deployable package

## üìë Node application

Create a new Node.js with the `axp add node` command. It will setup *jest* for tests.

Additional to this. The actyx manifest for a docker App is generated.

```bash
axp add node --appName "awesome App" --test
```

After executing this command you will find some new scripts in you package.json

- `node:<appName>:start` run the `index.ts` in your application
- `node:<appName>:build` build the node js application to deploy it
- `node:<appName>:package` use the ax-manifest to create a deployable package

## üêü Add a new actyx fish

```bash
axp addFish materialRequest --registry
```

Following options are available when you add a fish:
