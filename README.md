# Actyx-Project-CLI

Create a new project within seconds and start something awesome! This tool gives you the opportunity to create a TypeScript Node.js or a React application with one command.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the Actyx-Project-CLI globally to have access to wherever you are. [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actyx-contrib/axp).

```shell
npm install -g @actyx-contrib/axp
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Init Project

The installed `axp` tool will create you a monorepo with git, ESLint, and TypeScript.

In this project, you can add your apps with the `axp add <appType>` command.

```bash
axp init
```

The init step is optional. You can directly create an new app with `axp add [ui|node]`

## üìë React application

Create a new React-App with the `axp add ui` command. It will user _parcel_ as build tool.

The actyx manifest for a WebView app is generated automatically.

```bash
axp add ui --appName "awesome Ui" --test
```

After executing this command you will find some new scripts in you package.json

- `ui:<appName>:start` run the app in dev mode with automatic rebuild
- `ui:<appName>:build` build the React application to deploy it

## üìë Node application

Create a new Node.js with the `axp add node` command.

```bash
axp add node --appName "awesome App" --test --docker
```

After executing this command you will find some new scripts in you package.json

- `node:<appName>:start` run the `index.ts` in your application
- `node:<appName>:build` build the node js application to deploy it
- `node:<appName>:clean` remove the build folder.

## üõ†Ô∏è Add features

In AXP some widely used standard tools have been integrated, which can be activated via `axp addFeature <appName> <feature>`.

### UI apps

The following features are available for your UI application.

- `test` / `jest`: Add jest as test suit to your application and generate an example test for you. ([jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started))
- `storybook`: Add storybook to your complete project and add an example to your selected app. ([storybook.js.org](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction))
- `cordova`: Add a cordova wrapper in the app to package your app as executable for Android / Windows / MAC. ([cordova.apache.org](https://cordova.apache.org/))

### Node apps

The following features are available for a node application.

- `test` / `jest`: Both commands add jest as test suit to your application and generate an example test for you ([jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started))
- `docker`: Create some docker definitions to deploy your application as container ([docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/))

## ü§ì Developer tools

The best way to work and test the project is to run the `npm run build:watch` and `npm link` it once. From this moment on, you can manipulate the code and try the `axp` cli command in any directory
